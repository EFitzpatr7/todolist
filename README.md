# todolist

> To do list linked to Firebase

## What is this?
This is a simple to-do list I created as an example of Vue.js functionality. It is the first project I have ever created using both webpack and Vue, so there is still a lot to learn.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
